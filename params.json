{"name":"BlocklyCraft","tagline":"Write Minecraft Plugins with Blockly, visual programming editor","body":"# Introduction\r\nI created BlocklyCraft to play with my kids and try to get them into more creative gameplay. I'm a huge fan of visual programming since the early days of [Pure Data][pd]: live coding is fun and live coding with Minecraft and with kids is even better!\r\n\r\nBlocklyCraft started out as a copy/paste of the [work][pr] of Michael Vorburger & Lauro Canonica for the [Devoxx4Kids Lugano][Devoxx] event.\r\n\r\nBlocklyCraft is based on [ScriptCraft][sc], a Minecraft Mod that lets you extend Minecraft using the Javascript Programming Language. ScriptCraft makes modding Minecraft easier. It includes a logo-like \"Drone\" object that can be used to build complex buildings, roads, villages, even entire cities. It also includes many other features that make modding Minecraft easier.\r\n\r\nIf you're new to visual programming, I highly recommend to start with\r\n * [Scratch][scratched]\r\n * [Blockly \"Generating JavaScript\" demo][bldem]\r\n\r\n# Example\r\nLet's make a 2 floor house in Blockly editor:\r\n\r\n![House Blockly Command](src/main/js/www/docs/house_command.jpg?raw=true \"\")\r\n\r\nAt the in-game prompt, type:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/jsp house\r\n```\r\n![House](src/main/js/www/docs/house_run.jpg?raw=true \"\")\r\n\r\nSomehow a sheep and a chicken got interested, they are NOT part of the code above.\r\n\r\n[pd]: https://puredata.info/\r\n[sc]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft\r\n[scratched]: https://scratch.mit.edu/\r\n[bldem]: https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/generator/index.html\r\n[pr]: https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft/pull/257\r\n[Devoxx]: https://twitter.com/vorburger/status/597075410040553472\r\n\r\n# Description\r\nBlocklyCraft is a plugin for Minecraft Servers which lets younger programmers to create their own Minecraft Mods. Mods are written with [Blockly][blockly], a visual programming editor. It runs in a web browser, and resembles [Scratch][scratch].\r\n\r\nBlocklyCraft works with all of the following Minecraft Server software:\r\n* [SpigotMC][sg] (Bukkit-compatible)(Recommended)\r\n* [CanaryMod][cm] \r\n* [GlowStone][gs] (Bukkit-compatible)\r\n\r\nBecause BlocklyCraft is based on ScriptCraft, the mod also lets you enter javascript commands at the in-game prompt. To bring up the in-game prompt press the `/` key then type `js ` followed by any javascript statement.  For example: `/js 1 + 1` will print 2.\r\n\r\n[blockly]: https://github.com/google/blockly\r\n[scratch]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_%28programming_language%29\r\n\r\n# Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* You will need to have Java version 6 or later installed on your\r\n  machine. Check the version by typing `java -version` at a command\r\n  prompt.\r\n\r\n* You will need to [install SpigotMC][is] on your\r\n  machine. SpigotMC is a customized version of Minecraft Server that\r\n  makes it easy to install plugins and customize Minecraft.\r\n\r\n* If you don't want to compile from source SpigotMC, you can use \r\nCanaryMod and [download the CanaryMod server here][ic]\r\n\r\n[sg]: http://www.spigotmc.org/\r\n[cm]: http://canarymod.net/\r\n[gs]: http://www.glowstone.net/\r\n[is]: https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/\r\n[ic]: http://canarymod.net/releases\r\n\r\n# BlocklyCraft Plugin Installation\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to compile the plugin from source, you can [download the\r\ncompiled plugin here][dl] and copy it to the Minecraft server plugins directory.\r\n\r\n[dl]:#\r\n# Post Install\r\n\r\nOnce installed, a new scriptcraft/plugins directory is automatically\r\ncreated.  All files in the scriptcraft/plugins directory will be\r\nautomatically loaded when the server starts.  *Only players who are\r\nops can use this plugin.* You can grant a player `op` privileges by\r\ntyping 'op <username>' at the server console prompt or by adding the\r\nplayer's username to the ops.txt file in your server directory.\r\n\r\nLaunch the server, then open [http://localhost:7070][local] in a web browser. Create your first command by following the example below, don't forget to give a name to your command (`house` in the example) and then click the deploy red button on the top right, this will compile the javascript and install it on the Minecraft server.\r\n\r\n![Hello Blockly](src/main/js/www/docs/hello_world_command.png?raw=true \"\")\r\n\r\nthen launch the Minecraft client and create a new server connection. The IP address will be `localhost` . Once you've connected to your server and have entered the game, look at a ground-level block and type the name of the newly created command:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/jsp hello\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a stone structure 2 blocks wide by 1\r\nblocks high by 4 block long.\r\n\r\n![Hello Minecraft](src/main/js/www/docs/hello_world_run.jpg?raw=true \"\")\r\n\r\nA BlockyCraft mod for Minecraft is just a JavaScript source file (.js)\r\nlocated in the scriptcraft/plugins/blocklycraft/ directory.\r\n```javascript\r\ncommand( 'hello', function ( parameters, player ) {\r\n    var theDrone = new Drone(player);\r\n    theDrone.up();\r\n    theDrone.chkpt('start');\r\n    var timeoutStop = new Date().getTime()+500;\r\n    theDrone.box ('1',4,1,2);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nAll .js files in this directory will be automatically loaded when the server starts and reloaded each time you deploy from the Blockly visual programming editor\r\n\r\n\r\n[local]: http://localhost:7070\r\n\r\n# Create a Paddock\r\n\r\n![Paddock Command](src/main/js/www/docs/paddock_command.jpg?raw=true \"\")\r\n![Paddock run](src/main/js/www/docs/paddock_run.jpg?raw=true \"\")","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
